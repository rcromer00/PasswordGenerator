README - Password Generator

Steps I took in order to complete project:

1. First I listed all of the characters that would be necessary inorder to generate a unique password to the users liking by listing all upper and lower case letters as well as all special characters and numbers

2. Next I created a function that generated a prompt upon clicking, which would then ask the user a series of questions regarding the criteria they would like their password to meet

3. I then created 'if' statements that would generate a random uppercase/lowercase letter, a random special character, and a random number by using the 'Math.floor' and 'Math.random' elements.

And lastly I added a 'for' loop to push the possible characters
